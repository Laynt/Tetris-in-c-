Tetris.c
here is the tetris project we had to do.
compile : make
execute the tetris  : ./game 


Tetris work without the folder makefile 
if u want to run it without it just : 
gcc main.c -o main


To stop the game without loose when u are on just make a : ctrl + c


Problem : 
 1) When you choose the second and the third I on the game there is a space of 1 under the shape.
