Tetris.c
here is the tetris project we had to do.
compile : make
exec ./game


Tetris work without the folder makefile 

if u want to run it without it just : 
gcc main.c -o main

To stop the game without loose when u are on just make a : ctrl + c


Problems : 
 1) When you choose the second and the third I on the game there is a space of 1 under the shape. 
 2) The shapes cant touch the sky and the 2 last row cant be completed.
